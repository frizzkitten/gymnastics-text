Welcome to the future of Sign Up!

This program will allow you to sign up for practice through text. Texting to sign up will sign you up on the same google doc as everyone else. This is only supposed to make life easier and is in addition to the sign up sheet if you would like to use it (which you should because it’s cool and fun)… it is not required and signing up on the sheet will still work as usual!

First time users: text anything to 608-888-9012 and it will take you through how to set up your default pickup options. Please use your name as it appears on the sign up sheet!

Commands you can send:
People: see who’s signed up already
Time: reminder of the time and location of practice for the day
Sign Up: put your name on the sheet
* For now, only driver/non driver for normal pickup locations (we’ll work on only a ride back/can drive one way soon)
Drop: take your name off of the sheet
Settings: change your default pickup location or name

Important things to know:
* Everything you text to the number should give you a response. If you do not get a response after a longer than normal amount of time, please let Raizel, Austin or Kevin know!
* If you get a message that the program failed, the sheet is probably locked and you can try again later, but always feel free to check the sheet online.
* Cancel, Stop, Unsubscribe, End, Quit, Start, Yes, Help, Info are reserved words for the texting service, so they will send you a text about their service that we did not program (so just don’t use them).
* If you have ideas on how to make the program better let us know!
