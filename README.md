# gymnastics-text

An easy way for UW gymnasts to sign up for practice via text! Works by interacting with the spreadsheet, which can also be used to sign up, so the two will always be in sync.

## Getting Started

You will need to do a few things in order to get this project running.

### To Run Locally

#### 1. Get mlab.com credentials

The database used for the users is stored by mlab.com. There is a main account (madisonGymnastics). Get an admin to create a user account for you by having them go to mlab.com, selecting "Users" (next to "Collections") and clicking "Add database user."

#### 2. Get Twilio info

Two options here. 
1. Get the password, account SID, and auth token for the main number, using ameyer24@wisc.edu's account (contact Austin Meyer about that)
2. Make your own Twilio account. Buy a phone number through Twilio.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
